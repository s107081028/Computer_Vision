    # of the filter matrix.)

    # restriction makes it unambigious which pixel in the filter is the center

    # Boundary handling can be tricky. The filter can't be centered on pixels         
    # at the image boundary without parts of the filter being out of bounds. You      
    # should simply recreate the default behavior of scipy.signal.convolve2d --       
    # pad the input image with zeros, and return a filtered image which matches the   
    # input resolution. A better approach is to mirror the image content over the     
    # boundaries for padding.
